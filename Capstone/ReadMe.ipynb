    "The goal of this project is to segment point cloud using two different methods for comparison.  The first method will use a pointwise radial neighborhood method, where neighboring points will be within a radius $r$ of a point, $p_0$.   The second method will use a cylindrical nieghborhood method.  This study will apply a random forest classifier to point features derived from these two neighborhood methods.  Multiple radii will be used to capture additional geometric context.  A total of 6 scales will be used with a voxelized downsampling to maintain computational efficiency.\n",

    "This study focuses on radial and cylindrical neighborhoods on a terrestrial [LiDAR (light detection and ranging)](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-lidar-data-and-where-can-i-download-it) scan.  Cylindrical neighborhoods are mostly used for aerial scans, while radial neighborhoods and k nearest neighborhoods are primarily used on mobile or terrestrial data.  This study will test the two radial neighborhood types on a mobile LiDAR scan.  [Thomas et al]((https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8490990) demonstrated that geometrically uniform neighborhoods like radial neighbors give better results than a *k nearest neighbors* approach, while *k nearest neighbors* are less computationally expensive.
