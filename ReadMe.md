# Truman Data Science 

This is a general purpose repository for the [Truman State University data science masters program](https://www.truman.edu/majors-programs/graduate-studies/data-science-2/).  The folders are named based on the coursework I found most interesting or helpful to post to github.  

## Capstone

### Introduction

The goal of this project is to segment two different types of point clouds using a random forest classifier.  We will compare two methods: neighborhood multiscaling as described [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8490990).  The method uses a downsampling approach that is proportional to the search radius.
